“Words can be like X-rays if you use them properly -- they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.” - Aldous Huxley, Brave New World 

In this blog I will sporadically put together some words about things I care about or things that I think may be useful to share. 
Those words will mostly orbit around science, technology and arts, but also about cultures. Stick around if you are interested in any of the topics.
