For now this is an experiment.

### More Information

I am a researcher interested on innovative science and technology with a strong inclination towards energy conversion systems. I have an MSc in Engineering Physics with specialization in Nanotechnology. I really enjoy to look at new ideas, not only technological but also artistic (I also have a music degree on classical piano) and cultural (I have lived across 4 different countries in the last 6 years, speaking fluently 3 languages and basic knowledge of 2 more including Mandarin).
